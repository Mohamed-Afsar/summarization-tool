Mojo ermöglicht es, entweder in Python zu programmieren oder bis auf die Hardware-Ebene herunterzuskalieren, ohne dass C++ oder CUDA erforderlich sind. Es wurde von dem Schöpfer der Swift-Programmiersprache entwickelt, um die Lücke zwischen Forschung und Produktion zu schließen, indem es Python-Syntax und -Ökosystem mit systemnaher Programmierung und Metaprogrammierungsmerkmalen kombiniert.
